(* Just to be as explicit as possible:

   Each macro has a priority number and a direction preference.
   If the priority number is high, the macro is high priority and it gets interpreted first.
   If sweep direction is L, macros are evaluated "leftmost first"  (moving left to right)
   If sweep direction is R, macros are evaluated "rightmost first" (moving right to left)
   If there are multiple macros of the same priority, all the L macros (prefer-left)
   are interpreted first, and all of the R macros (prefer-right) after.
   (I recommend against mixing L and R macros on a single priority.)

   Notice how priority and sweep direction differ from "precedence" and "associativity".
   They're essentially opposites. The later a splitter macro evaluates, the higher
   "precedence" the associated operator will appear to have, because splitter macros
   wrap parenthesis around *everything else*, not around themselves.
   For similar reasons, right-preference likes like left-associativity and vice versa.

   So this table goes:
    - From lowest priority to highest priority.
    - From lowest-magnitude priority number to highest-magnitude priority number.
    - From last-evaluated to earliest-evaluated macro.
    - From closest-binding operators to loosest-binding operators
      (In C language: From "high precedence" to "low precedence" operators)
